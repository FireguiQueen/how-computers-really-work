# Book: How computers really work
My notes and explications from the book "How computers really work", by Matthew Justice. 

## Who is this book for?
This book is for anyone who wants to understand how computers work. You _don't need_ to have _any prior knowledge_ of the topics covered. On the other hand, if you already have a background in programming or eletronics, this book can you help expand your knowledge in other areas. 

The book is written for the __self-motivated learner__, someone who is comfortable with basic math and science, and who is already familier with _using_ computers and smartphones, but who still has questions about __how they work__. 

## About the author
"Matthew Justice is a software engineer. He spent 17 years at
Microsoft where he took on various roles, including debugging
the Windows kernel, developing automated fixes, and leading a
team of engineers responsible for building diagnostic tools and
services. He has worked on low-level software (the operating
system) and on software far removed from the underlying
hardware (such as web applications).".

## Where to buy it 
In appreciation of the author, it's not a problem to say where you can find the book to buy. <br>


## Where to download its PDF
Search on google (or whatever engine search you use). As a developer, you must have one of the most important skills of a developer: __the ability to search__. 
> At the moment, I'm reading the PDF, but I'll surely buy it in the future to help and support the author.

## How important is to know how computers work underneath 
When you use a hammer, it's not necessary to think hard about how and why it works. The tool is pretty simple: the long handle acts as a lever, amplifying the user's effort, while the mass of the hammerhead and the speed of the swing generate momentum. This momentum is then focused onto a small area, making the hammer effective for driving nails, breaking objects, or shaping materials.

Once we have tools that use electric processes to work, we are dealing with more complex tools. Understanding how they work is harder and more laborious. Many "developers" are just emerging these days, but only a few of them are interested in knowing how their tools work; they are merely using them.

It's crucial to know how computers work to be at least one step away from being a mediocre developer. It doesn't matter which segment you're following in the computer science world (backend, frontend, DevOps, etc.); you should know how and why our computers work. To learn that, you'll need to learn physics and then electronics.
