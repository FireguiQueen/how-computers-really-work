# How computers really work
Notes and explications from the book "How computers really work", by Matthew Justice. 

<br>

## How to download its PDF
Search on google (or whatever engine search you use). I'm not being rude, to be clear, my point is help you to develop one of the most important skills of a developer: __the ability to search__. 

## Is it important to read this book? 
Not this book in particular; but in my opinion, it's crucial to know __how computers work__, to be, at least, one step away from being a mediocre developer.

It __doesn't matter__ which segment you're following in the computer science world (backend, frontend, devops...), you must know how and why our computers work.
