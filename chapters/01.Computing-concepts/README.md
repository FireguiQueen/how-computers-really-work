# Computers are everywhere
Computers are everywhere now: in our homes, our schools, our
offices â€” you might find a computer in your pocket, on your
wrist, or even in your refrigerator.

At these days, it's easier than ever to find and user a computer; but only a 
few people really know how they work.

The goal of this book is to lay out ("to define") the foundational principles of computing
in a way that anyone, with curiosity, and a bit of technical bent, can follow.
