# What is a computer?
When people hear the word _"computer"_, most think of a laptop, a smartphone or a personal computer (PC). But in reality, any electronic device __capable of carrying out a set of logical instructions__ is a computer. With that in mind, we can list many types of computers around us: video-game consoles, smart-watches, smart televisions,
smart air conditioners... 

## Many devices are turning into computers
Many devices are turning into computers these days. Even a refrigerator can function as a computer now. However, it's important to note that the refrigerator still operates as it did before; the difference lies in the addition of microprocessors/microcontrolers (components that execute logical instructions).

With microprocessors integrated into our refrigerators, we gain more functionalities. For example, we can regulate the temperature using a phone, set specific times for cooling and warming, and even view the contents through a display.

## Turning an old device into a computer
My old refrigerator isn't a computer. When I needed to adjust its temperature, I 
just turned the fridge's knob, and the process behind this is actually very simple:  

The knob manages a thermostat, and it has a sensor that reacts to changes in internal temperature, turning on/off the compressor (device used to produce "cold air").
When the compressor is on, it produces 'cold air', when it's off, the production of "cold air" stops. Thinking in a knob that goes from 1 to 4; when I set '2' on the knob, I'm actually setting a range, and if the internal temperature raises above the range, the compressor
turns off. Then, the thermostat detects an internal temperature below my set range, the compressor turns on again to return to the defined range.

__The point is__: To transform this old refrigerator into a computer, all I need to do is install a microcontroller and have it control the fridge. Now, I can simply set some instructions, and when I execute them, it fully controls the fridge. It's not an easy task, but it's totally possible.  

With all that said, we are in a new era, where even refrigerators can be computers. We are able to control the temperature using our own phones. And that is only possible due to the fact that these devices, are now using micro-computers (a componcapable of carrying out a set of logical instructions.
