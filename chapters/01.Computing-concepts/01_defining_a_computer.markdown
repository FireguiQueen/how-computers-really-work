# What is a computer?
When people hear the word _"computer"_, most think of a laptop, a smartphone or a personal computer (PC).
But in reality, any electronic device capable of carrying out a set of logical instructions is a computer.
With that in mind, we can list many types of computers around us: video-game consoles, smart-watches, smart televisions,
smart air conditioners... 

So even a microwave and a refrigerator can be a computer; however, it doesn't mean that every microwave/refrigerator 
is a computer. For example, my old refrigerator wasn't a computer. When I needed to adjust its temperature, I 
just turned the fridge's knob, and the process behind this is actually very simple:  

The knob manages a thermostat, and it has a sensor that reacts to changes in internal temperature, turning on/off the compressor (device used to produce "cold air").
When the compressor is on, it produces 'cold air', when it's off, the production of "cold air" stops.
Thinking in a knob that goes from 1 to 4; when I set '2' on the knob, I'm actually setting a range, and if the internal temperature raises above the range, the compressor
turns off. Then, the thermostat detects an internal temperature below my set range, the compressor turns on again to return to the defined range.

With all that said, we are in a new era, where even refrigerators can be computers. We are able to control 
the temperature using our own phones. And that is only possible due to the fact that these devices, are now, 
capable of carrying out a set of logical instructions.
